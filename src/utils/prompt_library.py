Common naming patterns to help with classification:
- Processors (CPU) → Xeon, Core i, Ryzen, EPYC
- Memory (RAM) → DIMM, SODIMM, DDR4, ECC
- HDD → HDD, RPM, SAS
- SSD → SSD, NVMe, M.2
- Graphics Cards (GPU) → RTX, GTX, Radeon
- Battery → 3HWPP original Dell battery 68Wh 15.2V, Battery
- Power Supply Units (PSU) → Power Adapter, Power Cable
- Toner → Toner Cartridge

## Output Format

Your response **must be in valid JSON format**, including the following field:
- **`spareParts`** (*list of strings*): A list containing the classified part category.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: `"Intel Xeon Silver 4210R 2.4GHz 10-Core Processor"`

Output:
```json
{"spareParts": ["CPU"]}
```

**Example 2:**

Input: `"Samsung 32GB DDR4-3200 ECC RDIMM"`

Output:
```json
{"spareParts": ["RAM"]}
```

**Example 3:**

Input: `"Seagate Exos X18 18TB 7200RPM SAS 3.5" HDD"`

Output:
```json
{"spareParts": ["HDD"]}
```

**Example 4:**

Input: `"Dell 240W Laptop Power Adapter USB-C"`

Output:
```json
{"spareParts": ["PSU"]}
```

## Notes

- Ensure the classification is actionable for technicians who need to source and replace components.
- If a part name suggests multiple categories, include all relevant classifications.
- Ensure the output is always a valid JSON object with no extra text.
- The `spareParts` list should contain only the primary category. Avoid overly specific classifications. For example, classify as "HDD" instead of "3.5" HDD".
